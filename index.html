     <!-- INHERITANCES -->
     <p class="inherit">
      Inheritance is a mechanism where some CSS properties of a parent element are automatically applied to its child elements.
  </p>
  <p class="unset">
      unset → behaves like inherit if property is naturally inheritable, otherwise like initial.
  </p>
  <p class="revert"> revert → resets the property to the value it would have from the browser/user stylesheet, ignoring your CSS rules.
  </p>
  <br></br>

  <!-- FLOAT -->
  <img src="./images/image-1.jpg">
  <p>The CSS float property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, 
      allowing text and inline content to wrap around it. It was inspired by print media layouts, 
      such as newspapers and magazines.
  </p>

<!-- COLOR,CSS-VARIABLE -->
  <p id="RGB">RGB defines colors based on the combination of Red, Green, and Blue light.
    Each component can range from 0 to 255.
 </p>

 <p class="RGBA">
     RGBA is just RGB with transparency (alpha).
     Alpha defines opacity: 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
 </p>

 <p class="HEX">
     HEX colors are hexadecimal representations of RGB.
     Each color component (R, G, B) is represented by two hex digits (00 to FF).
 </p>

 <p class="HSL">
     HSL defines colors by hue, saturation, and lightness.
     Easier to think about in terms of color tones, rather than mixing red/green/blue.
 </p>

 <p>
     A CSS variable (also called a custom property) is a way to store a value that can be reused throughout your CSS.
